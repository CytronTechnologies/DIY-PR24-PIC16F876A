# PID Motor Controller
Sample source code for DIY PR24. Project description :  PR24 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to describe the application of PID control technique in motor position control. User can adjust the values of P, I and D and notify how these values can affect on the speed, steady state error stability and overshoot during the transient response of the DC motor. It also provides LCD (2x16 characters) for user to indicate the values of P, I, D and angle which selected by user. Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
